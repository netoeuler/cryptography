The Ciphertexts

This page links you to the ten ciphertexts that constituted the Cipher Challenge.

The competition is over and the £10,000 has now been won. Indeed, the solutions are available on-line via a paper written by the winners. However, you might still want to take up the challenge.

Stage 1 and Stage 2 are relatively easy.

Stage 3 and Stage 4 are harder – 3 is possibly harder than 4, so I would encourage you to skip 3 if you get stuck.

Stage 5 proved to be notoriously difficult.

Stage 6, Stage 7 and Stage 8 are tough, but were cracked by amateurs.

Stage 9 requires some computer power.

Stage 10 requires lots of computer power and even more brain power.

Good luck.
